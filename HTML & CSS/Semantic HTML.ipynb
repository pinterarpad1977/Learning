    "### Why use Semantic HTML?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accessibility: Semantic HTML makes webpages accessible for mobile devices and for people with disabilities as well. This is because screen readers and browsers are able to interpret the code better.\n",
    "- SEO: It improves the website SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, which is the process of increasing the number of people that visit your webpage. With better SEO, search engines are better able to identify the content of your website and weight the most important content appropriately.\n",
    "- Easy to Understand: Semantic HTML also makes the website’s source code easier to read for other web developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This basically means that we are using meaningful tags instead of just DIVs and SPANs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Semantic elements\n",
    "\n",
    "HEADER and NAV\n",
    "A <header> is a container usually for either navigational links or introductory content containing <h1> to <h6> headings. \n",
    "So use header instead of using a div with the id=\"header\"\n",
    "\n",
    "A <nav> is used to define a block of navigation links such as menus and tables of contents. It is important to note that <nav> can be used inside of the <header> element but can also be used on its own. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "MAIN and FOOTER\n",
    "The element <main> is used to encapsulate the dominant content within a webpage. This tag is separate from the <footer> and the <nav> of a web page since these elements don’t contain the principal content. By using <main> as opposed to a <div> element, screen readers and web browsers are better able to identify that whatever is inside of the tag is the bulk of the content.\n",
    "The MAIN can have a header too and probably some ARTICLE tags\n",
    "\n",
    "The content at the bottom of the subject information is known as the footer, indicated by the <footer> element. The footer contains information such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Contact information\n",
    "    Copyright information\n",
    "    Terms of use\n",
    "    Site Map\n",
    "    Reference to top of page links\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ARTICLE and SECTION\n",
    "<section> defines elements in a document, such as chapters, headings, or any other area of the document with the same theme. \n",
    "\n",
    "The <article> element holds content that makes sense on its own. <article> can hold content such as articles, blogs, comments, magazines, etc. An <article> tag would help someone using a screen reader understand where the article content (that might contain a combination of text, images, audio, etc.) begins and ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "A section element can be placed also within an article element\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ASIDE\n",
    "The <aside> element is used to mark additional information that can enhance another element but isn’t required in order to understand the main content. This element can be used alongside other elements such as <article> or <section>. Some common uses of the <aside> element are for:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Bibliographies\n",
    "    Endnotes\n",
    "    Comments\n",
    "    Pull quotes\n",
    "    Editorial sidebars\n",
    "    Additional information\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "FIGURE and FIGCAPTION\n",
    "<figure> is an element used to encapsulate media such as an image, illustration, diagram, code snippet, etc, which is referenced in the main flow of the document. \n",
    "<figcaption> is an element used to describe the media in the <figure> tag. Usually, <figcaption> will go inside <figure>. This is different than using a <p> element to describe the content; if we decide to change the location of <figure>, the paragraph tag may get displaced from the figure while a <figcaption> will move with the figure. This is useful for grouping an image with a caption.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the content in <figure> is related to the main flow of the document, its position is independent. This means that you can remove it or move it somewhere else without affecting the flow of the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "AUDIO and ATTRIBUTES\n",
    "The <audio> element is used to embed audio content into a document. Like <video>, <audio> uses src to link the audio source.\n",
    "\n",
    "<audio> or\n",
    "<audio autoplay controls>                                                                           \n",
    "  <source src=\"iAmAnAudioFile.mp3\" type=\"audio/mp3\">\n",
    "</audio>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "VIDEO and EMBED\n",
    "The <video> element makes it clear that a developer is attempting to display a video to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some attributes that can alter a video playback include:\n",
    "\n",
    "    controls: When added in, a play/pause button will be added onto the video along with volume control and a fullscreen option.\n",
    "    autoplay: The attribute which results in a video automatically playing as soon as the page is loaded.\n",
    "    loop: This attribute results in the video continuously playing on repeat.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example of <video> being used with the controls attribute:\n",
    "\n",
    "<video src=\"coding.mp4\" controls>Video not supported</video>\n",
    "\n",
    "the <embed> tag, which can embed any media content including videos, audio files, and gifs from an external source. This means that websites that have an embed button have some form of media content that can be added to other websites. The <embed> tag is a self-closing tag, unlike the <video> element. Note that <embed> is a deprecated tag and other alternatives, such as <video>, <audio> and <img>, should be used in its place, but is being taught for legacy purposes.\n"
