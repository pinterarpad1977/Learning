    "- Named colors — English words that describe colors, also called keyword colors\n",
    "- RGB — numeric values that describe a mix of red, green, and blue -> color: rgb(23, 45, 23);\n",
    "- Hexadecimal - starts with # plus 6 nums or chars. If the hex pairs are the same 3 chars are enough #FFF\n",
    "- HSL — numeric values that describe a mix of hue, saturation, and lightness\n",
    "\n",
    "Hue is the first number. It refers to an angle on a color wheel. Red is 0 degrees, Green is 120 degrees, Blue is 240 degrees, and then back to Red at 360. You can see an example of a color wheel below.\n",

    "\n",
    "Saturation refers to the intensity or purity of the color. The saturation increases towards 100% as the color becomes richer. The saturation decreases towards 0% as the color becomes grayer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lightness refers to how light or dark the color is. Halfway, or 50%, is normal lightness. Imagine a sliding dimmer on a light switch that starts halfway. Sliding the dimmer up towards 100% makes the color lighter, closer to white. Sliding the dimmer down towards 0% makes the color darker, closer to black.\n",
    "\n",
    "HSL is convenient for adjusting colors. In RGB, making the color a little darker may affect all three color components. In HSL, that’s as easy as changing the lightness value. HSL is also useful for making a set of colors that work well together by selecting various colors that have the same lightness and saturation but different hues."

The name can be anything you choose, but it must be surrounded by quotation marks. In the example, the font is named 'MyParagraphFont', as this font will be used for all paragraphs.\n",
    "    The src property contains three values, each specifying the relative path to the font file and its format. In this example, the font files are stored inside a folder named fonts within the working directory.\n",
    "    Note that the ordering for the different formats is important because our browser will start from the top of the list and search until it finds a font format that it supports. Read more on format prioritization on CSS-Tricks.\n",
