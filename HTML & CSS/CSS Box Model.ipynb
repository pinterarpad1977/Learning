    "### The Box Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The box model comprises the set of properties that define parts of an element that take up space on a web page. The model includes the content area’s size (width and height) and the element’s padding, border, and margin. The properties include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- width and height: The width and height of the content area.\n",
    "- padding: The amount of space between the content area and the border.\n",
    "- border: The thickness and style of the border surrounding the content area and padding.\n",
    "- margin: The amount of space between the border and the outside edge of the element.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Height and Width\n",
    "\n",
    "An element’s content has two dimensions: a height and a width. By default, the dimensions of an HTML box are set to hold the raw contents of the box.\n",
    "The CSS height and width properties can be used to modify these default dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pixels allow you to set the exact size of an element’s box (width and height). When the width and height of an element are set in pixels, it will be the same size on all devices — an element that fills a laptop screen will overflow a mobile screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Borders\n",
    "\n",
    "A border is a line that surrounds an element, like a frame around a painting. Borders can be set with a specific width, style, and color:\n",
    "\n",
    "- width—The thickness of the border. A border’s thickness can be set in pixels or with one of the following keywords: thin, medium, or thick.\n",
    "- style—The design of the border. Web browsers can render any of 10 different styles. Some of these styles include: none, dotted, and solid.\n",
    "- color—The color of the border. Web browsers can render colors using a few different formats, including 140 built-in color keywords.\n",
    "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value\n",
    "- the border-radius property can round border corners\n",
    "- You can create a border that is a perfect circle by first creating an element with the same width and height, and then setting the radius equal to half the width of the box, which is 50%.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Padding\n",
    "\n",
    "The space between the contents of a box and the borders of a box is known as padding. \n",
    "The padding property is often used to expand the background color and make the content look less cramped.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to be more specific about the amount of padding on each side of a box’s content, you can use the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "    padding-top\n",
    "    padding-right\n",
    "    padding-bottom\n",
    "    padding-left\n",
    "\n",
    "Padding shorthands:\n",
    "- 4 values: p.content-header {padding: 6px 11px 4px 9px;}\n",
    "- top, right, bottm, left\n",
    "- 3 values: top, left+right, bottom\n",
    "- 2 values: top+bottom, left+right\n",
    "\n",
    "### Margin\n",
    "\n",
    "Margin refers to the space directly outside of the box. The margin property is used to specify the size of this space. \n",
    "This means that other HTML elements on the page cannot come within x pixels of the element’s border.\n",
    "The margin has the same logic shorthand as the padding\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Auto\n",
    "\n",
    "The margin property also lets you center content. However, you must follow a few syntax requirements. Take a look at the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "div.headline {\n",
    "  width: 400px;\n",
    "  margin: 0 auto;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, margin: 0 auto; will center the divs in their containing elements. The 0 sets the top and bottom margins to 0 pixels. The auto value instructs the browser to adjust the left and right margins until the element is centered within its containing element.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to center an element, a width must be set for that element. Otherwise, the width of the div will be automatically set to the full width of its containing element, like the <body>, for example. It’s not possible to center an element that takes up the full width of the page, since the width of the page can change due to display and/or browser window size.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Margin Collapse\n",
    "\n",
    "Side margins will add up\n",
    "Vertical margins will collapse and the bigger of them will be used\n",
    "\n",
    "### Minimum and Maximum Height and Width\n",
    "\n",
    "Because a web page can be viewed through displays of differing screen size, the content on the web page can suffer from those changes in size. To avoid this problem, CSS offers two properties that can limit how narrow or how wide an element’s box can be sized to:\n",
    "\n",
    "    min-width—this property ensures a minimum width of an element’s box.\n",
    "    max-width—this property ensures a maximum width of an element’s box.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    min-height — this property ensures a minimum height for an element’s box.\n",
    "    max-height — this property ensures a maximum height of an element’s box.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overflow\n",
    "\n",
    "The overflow property controls what happens to content that spills, or overflows, outside its box. The most commonly used values are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    hidden—when set to this value, any content that overflows will be hidden from view.\n",
    "    scroll—when set to this value, a scrollbar will be added to the element’s box so that the rest of the content can be viewed by scrolling.\n",
    "    visible—when set to this value, the overflow content will be displayed outside of the containing element. Note, this is the default value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resetting Defaults\n",
    "\n",
    "All major web browsers have a default stylesheet they use in the absence of an external stylesheet. These default stylesheets are known as user agent stylesheets. In this case, the term user agent is a technical term for the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "User agent stylesheets often have default CSS rules that set default values for padding and margin. This affects how the browser displays HTML elements, which can make it difficult for a developer to design or style a web page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many developers choose to reset these default values so that they can truly work with a clean slate.\n",
    "\n",
    "* {\n",
    "  margin: 0;\n",
    "  padding: 0;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visibility\n",
    "\n",
    "Elements can be hidden from view with the visibility property.\n",
    "\n",
    "The visibility property can be set to one of the following values:\n",
    "\n",
    "    hidden — hides an element.\n",
    "    visible — displays an element.\n",
    "    collapse — collapses an element.\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "  <li>Explore</li>\n",
    "  <li>Connect</li>\n",
    "  <li class=\"future\">Donate</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    ".future {\n",
    "  visibility: hidden;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, the list item with a class of future will be hidden from view in the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind, however, that users can still view the contents of the list item (e.g., Donate) by viewing the source code in their browser. Furthermore, the web page will only hide the contents of the element. It will still leave an empty space where the element is intended to display.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: What’s the difference between display: none and visibility: hidden? An element with display: none will be completely removed from the web page. An element with visibility: hidden, however, will not be visible on the web page, but the space reserved for it will.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Why Change the Box Model?\n",
    "\n",
    "The last lesson focused on the most important aspects of the box model: box dimensions, borders, padding, and margin.\n",
    "\n",
    "The box model, however, has an awkward limitation regarding box dimensions. This limitation is best illustrated with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h1>Hello World</h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "h1 {\n",
    "  border: 1px solid black;\n",
    "  height: 200px;\n",
    "  width: 300px;\n",
    "  padding: 10px;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, a heading element’s box has solid, black, 1 pixel thick borders. The height of the box is 200 pixels, while the width of the box is 300 pixels. A padding of 10 pixels has also been set on all four sides of the box’s content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, under the current box model, the border thickness and the padding will affect the dimensions of the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 10 pixels of padding increases the height of the box to 220 pixels and the width to 320 pixels. Next, the 1-pixel thick border increases the height to 222 pixels and the width to 322 pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under this box model, the border thickness and padding are added to the overall dimensions of the box. This makes it difficult to accurately size a box. Over time, this can also make all of a web page’s content difficult to position and manage.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this brief lesson, you’ll learn how to use a different technique that avoids this problem altogether.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Box Model: Content-Box\n",
    "\n",
    "Many properties in CSS have a default value and don’t have to be explicitly set in the stylesheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the default font-weight of text is normal, but this property-value pair is not typically specified in a stylesheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same can be said about the box model that browsers assume. In CSS, the box-sizing property controls the type of box model the browser should use when interpreting a web page.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default value of this property is content-box. This is the same box model that is affected by border thickness and padding.\n",
    "\n",
    "actual rendered width = width + padding + border\n",
    "\n",
    "### Box Model: Border-Box\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, we can reset the entire box model and specify a new one: border-box.\n",
    "\n",
    "* {\n",
    "  box-sizing: border-box;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "The code in the example above resets the box model to border-box for all HTML elements. This new box model avoids the dimensional issues that exist in the former box model you learned about.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this box model, the height and width of the box will remain fixed. The border thickness and padding will be included inside of the box, which means the overall dimensions of the box do not change.\n",
    "\n"
