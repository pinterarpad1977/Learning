    "### 1. The assert Statement\n",
    "Python provides an easy way to perform simple tests in our code - the `assert` statement. An `assert` statement can be used to test that a condition is met. If the condition evaluates to `False`, an `AssertionError` is raised with an optional error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general syntax looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```assert <condition>, 'Message if condition is not met' ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "```\n",
    "def times_ten(number):\n",
    "    return number * 100\n",
    "\n",
    "result = times_ten(20)\n",
    "assert result == 200, 'Expected times_ten(20) to return 200, instead got ' + str(result)\n",

    "In programming we can test a single unit of a program, such as a function, loop, or variable. A unit test validates a single behavior and will make sure all of the units of a program are functioning properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test a single function, we might create several test cases. A test case validates that a specific set of inputs produces an expected output for the unit we are trying to test.\n",

    "### Python's unittest Framework\n",
    "There are some problems with the approach to our previous unit tests that would make them difficult to maintain. First, we had to call each function specifically when a new test was created. We also didn’t have any way of grouping tests, which is necessary when the number of tests increases. Perhaps most importantly, if one test failed, the AssertionError would prevent any remaining tests from running!\n",

    "- This class will serve as the main storage of all our unit testing functions. Once we have the class, we need to change our test functions so that they are methods of the class. The `unittest` module requires that test functions begin with the word 'test'\n",
    "- Lastly, we need to change our `assert` statements to use the `assertEqual` method of `unittest.TestCase`. The framework requires that we use special methods instead of standard assert statements.\n",

When this happens, the device needs to be power cycled (shut off and then on) to restore Bluetooth functionality. We would not want tests to run if the device was already in a failed state because these results would not be valid. Furthermore, if our tests cause the Bluetooth module to fail, we want to restore it to a working state after the tests run. So, we add a test fixture to power cycle the device before and after each test. \n",
