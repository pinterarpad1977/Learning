    "Currently, if the token doesn’t exist in the input_features_dict dictionary (which keeps track of all words in the training data), our program has no way of handling it.\r\n",

    "Here are a few popular approaches to tackle unk- own words:\r\n",

This causes issues when working with a fairly limited dataset, since we may end up with the chatbot repeatedly asking the user to rephrase each in- put statement.\r\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Because we’re using a tiny dataset to train our model, we’re going to just ignore words that haven’t been added into input_features_dict during training.\r\n",

    "Fortunately, a simple if statement is all we need.\r\n",

Just like with a machine translation model, we want to accommodate new sentence structures and creativity, something we can do with a generative model for our chatbot.\r\n",

    "\r\n",
    "We’re also making a pretty big assumption right now in our chatbot architecture: the chatbot responses only depend on the previous turn of user input. The seq2seq model we have here won’t account for any previous dialog. For example, our chatbot has no way to handle a simple back-and-forth like ```this:\r\n",
