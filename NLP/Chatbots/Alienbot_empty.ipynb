    "# Alienbot\n",
    "The 1950s ushered in a slew of UFO sightings and excitement about outer space. Incidentally, the decade also brought about a new idea of artificial intelligence. The computer scientist Alan Turing proposed that if a computer was able to fool a human into believing it was human, the computer would be considered “intelligent.”\n",
    "\n",
    "While your bot may not pass a true Turing test, perhaps it could pass an “E.T.uring” test if you can successfully fool a human into believing that your chatbot is, in fact, an alien.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ve added a class called AlienBot to get you started; you’ll be digging into the main chatbot functionality. Take a look at what you have in:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the regex and random libraries are imported\n",
    "- a tuple of negative responses (you can add more!)\n",
    "- a tuple of commands for a user to exit the program\n",
    "- a tuple of random starter questions an alien might ask (feel free to add more)\n",
    "- a tuple of dictionaries called alienbabble with the chatbot’s main intent-utterance matching pairs — you’ll add to this later!\n",
    "- several methods for core chatbot functionality:\n",
    "    - .greet() will greet the user\n",
    "    - .make_exit() will check if a user has used an exit command\n",
    "    - .chat() will run the program allowing users to chat with the alien you created\n",
    "    - .match_reply() will match the response pairs in alienbabble for you\n",
    "- several methods associated with user intents\n",
    "    - .describe_planet_intent() will include responses about the alien’s planet\n",
    "    - .answer_why_intent() will include responses for why the alien is visiting\n",
    "    - .cubed_intent() is a method that returns the cube of a number, because these aliens are very good at math\n",
    "    - .no_match_intent() will respond with something general when none of the other intents are matched"
