    "### Handling the Conversation\r\n",
    "The start of most customer support conversations is formulaic. In the last exercise, we welcomed the user, then asked for their name and if they wanted help. Once you’re beyond this initial welcome, the conversation can start to go in many different directions. Usually, chatbots have a central method to handle the back-and-forth of a conversation.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In script.py, we created a method called .handle_conversation() that will be our central method to continue responding for as long as a user asks questions.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Because we start our conversation with the .welcome() method, the first step is to call our conversation handling met```hod:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "def welcome(self):\r\n",
    "  ...\r\n",
    "  self.handle_conversation(wi```ll_help)\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "To handle the indefinite length of a conversation, we use a while loop. The while loop can check if the user wants to continue the conversation after each response. Let’s say a user can only exit the conversation by responding with “stop.” Our while loop would look somet```hing like:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "def handle_conversation(self, reply):\r\n",
    "  while not (reply == \"stop\"):\r\n",
    "    reply = input(\"How can``` I help you?\")\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "At the moment, this code will respond “How can I help you?” to every user response but “stop” – not too useful. However, the while loop, as you’ll see over the next few exercises, provides a lot of flexibility for processing user input and responding with something \n",
    "\n",
    "### Exiting the Conversation\r\n",
    "In the last exercise, you made a while loop to respond to a user until they replied “stop.” Saying the word “stop” isn’t the only, nor is it the typical, way to end a conversation with someone. Instead, you may say something like:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "I have to leave, bye.\r\n",
    "I need to go. I’ll come back later.\r\n",
    "To account for the variety of statements someone could make to exit a conversation, we created a method called .make_exit(). The purpose of this method is to check whether the user wants to leave the conversation. If they do, it returns True. If not, it returns False.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The .make_exit() method accepts one argument, the user’s response. Within the method, we check whether the user’s response contains a word that is commonly used to exit a conversation, such as “bye” or “exit.” In script.py, we save a few of these words in a tuple called exit_com```mands.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "def make_exit(self, reply):\r\n",
    "  for exit_command in self.exit_commands:\r\n",
    "    if exit_command in reply:\r\n",
    "      print(\"Nice talking with you!\")\r\n",
    "      return True\r\n",
    "  \r\n",
    "```  return False\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In the code above, we iterate over each word in self.exit_commands. If there is a match between the user’s input and a word from self.exit_commands, the method prints “Ok, have a nice day!” and returns True. If there is not a match, then the method returns False.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "We can incorporate this method call into each loop using t```he following code:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "while not make_exit(reply):\r\n",
    "  reply ```= input(\"something \")\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "If .make_exit() returns True, then the loop will stop executing, and the conversation will end.that makes sense."

    "Tell the user how they can pay their bill\r\n",
    "We often refer to these actions as intents. Before we can trigger an intent, the chatbot must interpret the user’s statement. We often refer to the user’s statement as an utterance. In script.py, we added a class variable called matching phrases, which is a dictionary with the follo`wing:\r\n",
