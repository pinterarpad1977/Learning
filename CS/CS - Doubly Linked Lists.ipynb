    "### The concept\n",
    "\n",
    "Like a singly linked list, a doubly linked list is comprised of a series of nodes. Each node contains data and two links (or pointers) to the next and previous nodes in the list. The head node is the node at the beginning of the list, and the tail node is the node at the end of the list. The head node’s previous pointer is set to null and the tail node’s next pointer is set to null.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-life Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "    A music player with “next” and “previous” buttons\n",
    "    An app that shows you where your subway is on the train line\n",
    "    The “undo” and “redo” functionality in a web browser\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adding to the head\n",
    "\n",
    "When adding to the head of the doubly linked list, we first need to check if there is a current head to the list. If there isn’t, then the list is empty, and we can simply make our new node both the head and tail of the list and set both pointers to null. If the list is not empty, then we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Set the current head’s previous pointer to our new head.\n",
    "    Set the new head’s next pointer to the current head.\n",
    "    Set the new head’s previous pointer to null.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adding to the tail\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, there are two cases when adding a node to the tail of a doubly linked list. If the list is empty, then we make the new node the head and tail of the list and set the pointers to null. If the list is not empty, then we:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Set the current tail’s next pointer to the new tail\n",
    "    Set the new tail’s previous pointer to the current tail\n",
    "    Set the new tail’s next pointer to null\n",
    "\n",
    "### Removing from the list\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the extra pointer and tail property, removing the head from a doubly linked list is slightly more complicated than removing the head from a singly linked list. However, the previous pointer and tail property make it much simpler to remove the tail of the list, as we don’t have to traverse the entire list to be able to do it.\n",
    "Removing the head\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Removing the head \n",
    "\n",
    "involves updating the pointer at the beginning of the list. We will set the previous pointer of the new head (the element directly after the current head) to null, and update the head property of the list. If the head was also the tail, the tail removal process will occur as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Removing the tail\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, removing the tail involves updating the pointer at the end of the list. We will set the next pointer of the new tail (the element directly before the tail) to null, and update the tail property of the list. If the tail was also the head, the head removal process will occur as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Removing from the middle of the list\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to remove a node from the middle of the list. Since that node is neither the head nor the tail of the list, there are two pointers that must be updated:\n",
    "\n",
    "    We must set the removed node’s preceding node’s next pointer to its following node.\n",
    "    We must set the removed node’s following node’s previous pointer to its preceding node.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no need to change the pointers of the removed node, as updating the pointers of its neighboring nodes will remove it from the list. If no nodes in the list are pointing to it, the node is orphaned.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Review\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take a minute to review what we’ve covered about doubly linked lists in this lesson:\n",
    "\n",
    "    They are comprised of nodes that contain links to the next and previous nodes.\n",
    "    They are bidirectional, meaning it can be traversed in both directions.\n",
    "    They have a pointer to a single head node, which serves as the first node in the list.\n",
    "    They have a pointer to a single tail node, which serves as the last node in the list.\n",
    "    They require the pointers at the head of the list to be updated after addition to or removal of the head.\n",
    "    They require the pointers at the tail of the list to be updated after addition to or removed of the tail.\n",
    "    They require the pointers of the surrounding nodes to be updated after removal from the middle of the list.\n"

    "\n",
    "Node Class and Constructor\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we’ve learned about doubly linked lists, let’s implement one in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, a doubly linked list is a sequential chain of nodes, just like a singly linked list. The nodes we used for our singly linked lists contained two elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A value\n",
    "    A link to the next node\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between a doubly linked list and a singly linked list is that in a doubly linked list, the nodes have pointers to the previous node as well as the next node. This means that the doubly linked list data structure has a tail property in addition to a head property, which allows for traversal in both directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the nodes we will use for our doubly linked list contain three elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A value\n",
    "    A pointer to the previous node\n",
    "    A pointer to the next node\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the end-use of the doubly linked list, there are a variety of methods that we can define.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our use, we want to be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Add a new node to the head (beginning) of the list\n",
    "    Add a new node to the tail (end) of the list\n",
    "    Remove a node from the head of the list\n",
    "    Remove a node from the tail of the list\n",
    "    Find and remove a specific node by its value\n",
