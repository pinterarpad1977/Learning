    "### A conceptual overview of Queues.\n",
    "\n",
    "A queue is a data structure which contains an ordered set of data.\n",
    "Queues provide three methods for interaction:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Enqueue - adds data to the “back” or end of the queue\n",
    "    Dequeue - provides and removes data from the “front” or beginning of the queue\n",
    "    Peek - reveals data from the “front” of the queue without removing it\n",
    "\n",
    "This data structure mimics a physical queue of objects like a line of people buying movie tickets. Each person has a name (the data). The first person to enqueue, or get into line, is both at the front and back of the line. As each new person enqueues, they become the new back of the line.\n",
    "Queues are a FIFO data structure\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Queues can be implemented using a linked list as the underlying data structure. The front of the queue is equivalent to the head node of a linked list and the back of the queue is equivalent to the tail node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since operations are only allowed to affect the front or back of the queue, any traversal or modification to other nodes within the linked list is disallowed. Since both ends of the queue must be accessible, a reference to both the head node and the tail node must be maintained.\n",
    "\n",
    "One last constraint that may be placed on a queue is its length. If a queue has a limit on the amount of data that can be placed into it, it is considered a **bounded queue**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to stacks, attempting to enqueue data onto an already full queue will result in a **queue overflow**. If you attempt to dequeue data from an empty queue, it will result in a **queue underflow**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use our Node class and LinkedList class to create our Queue class.\n",
    "1. in the __init__ method we set a head and a tail to None\n",
    "2. if our Queue class is bounded we need to keepő track its size and have a max_size property\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we will add three new methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "    get_size() will return the value of the size property\n",
    "    has_space() will return True if the queue has space for another node\n",
    "    is_empty() will return true if the size is 0\n",
    "\n",
    "    Add a new parameter max_size to your __init__() method that has a default value of None. Inside the method:\n",
    "\n",
    "    create a max_size instance variable assigned to max_size\n",
    "    create another instance variable size and set it equal to 0\n",
    "\n",
    "    Inside Queue define a new method get_size() that returns the size instance property.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Below get_size(), define a new method called has_space().\n",
    "\n",
    "    Inside of has_space(), check the value of self.max_size.\n",
    "\n",
    "    If self.max_size is None, we will always have space in the queue, so we can return True\n",
    "    Otherwise, if there is a value in max_size, return True if max_size is greater than self.get_size()\n",
    "\n",
    "    Define another method is_empty for Queue. The method should return True if the queue is empty (if the size of the queue is 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Now we’ll make sure we aren’t attempting to peek() on an empty queue. After all, a deli server can’t get an order from a line with no customers!\n",
    "\n",
    "    At the top of your peek() method body, use is_empty() to see if the queue is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "    if so, the method should just print “Nothing to see here!”\n",
    "    if not, peek() will perform the same as it did before\n",
    "\n"

    "\n",
    "We can add items to the tail of our queue, but we remove them from the head using a method known as dequeue(), which is another way to say “remove from a queue”. Like enqueue(), we care about the size of the queue — but in the other direction, so that we prevent queue “underflow”. After all, you don’t want to remove something that isn’t there!\n",

    "\n",
    "    Add an if clause to check if the queue is not empty\n",

    "### Hash Maps - Conceptual\n",
    "\n",
    "In case of tabular data there is a relationship between the elements of a row. Each column corresponds to a different feature of the row. \n",
    "This relationship is called a map.\n",
    "Being a map means relating two pieces of information, but a map also has one further requirement: Every key must have just a single value assigned to it (or none). \n",
    "In the case of a map between two things, we don’t really care about the exact sequence of the data. We only care that a given input, when fed into the map, gives the accurate output. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use an array. An array uses indices to keep track of values in memory, so we’ll need a way of turning each key in our map to an index in our array.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a hashing function to turn our key into an array index.\n",
    "Some simple hash logics: add up the number of vowels in the key or assign a value to every letter in the alphabet (say A=1, B=2, etc.,) and add up all of those values\n",
    "\n",
    "A hashing function takes a string and returns an integer which is an index in our array. The integer should not be greater than the size of our array (we don't need more indicies than rows)\n",
    "When implementing the hash function then the hash value modulo array size grants that we have don't have greater indicies than array size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hashing function is also called a compression function because they will reduce any input into a  small range of possible values. Hashing is not a reversibole process if we know only the hash value.\n",
    "\n",
    "A hash function needs to be simple by design. Performing complex mathematical calculations that our hash table needs to compute every time it wants to assign or retrieve a value for a key will significantly damage a hash table’s performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hash functions also need to be able to take whatever types of data we want to use as a key. We only discussed strings, a very common use case, but it’s possible to use numbers as hash table keys as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "A very common hash function for integers, for example, is to perform the modular operation on it to make sure it’s less than the size of the underlying array. If the integer is already small enough to be an index into the array, there’s nothing to be done.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many hash functions implementations for strings take advantage of the fact that strings are represented internally as numerical data. Frequently a hash function will perform a shift of the data bitwise, which is computationally simple for a computer to do but also can predictably assign numbers to strings."

    "### Basic Hash Maps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. we need some sort of associated data that we’re hoping to preserve.\n",
    "2. we need an array of a fixed size to insert our data into.\n",
    "3. we need a hash function that translates the keys of our array into indexes into the array. The storage location at the index given by a hash is called the **hash bucket**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the compression, it’s likely that our hash function might produce the same hash for two different keys. This is known as a hash collision. There are several strategies for resolving hash collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Separate Chaining\n",
    "\n",
    "The separate chaining strategy avoids collisions by updating the underlying data structure. Instead of an array of values that are mapped to by hashes, it could be an array of linked lists!\n",
    "\n",
    "The user wants to assign a value to a key in the map. The hash map takes the key and transforms it into a hash code. The hash code is then converted into an index to an array using the modulus operation. If the value of the array at the hash function’s returned index is empty, a new linked list is created with the value as the first element of the linked list. If a linked list already exists at the address, append the value to the linked list given.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is effective for hash functions that are particularly good at giving unique indices, so the linked lists never get very long. But in the worst-case scenario, where the hash function gives all keys the same index, lookup performance is only as good as it would be on a linked list. Hash maps are frequently employed because looking up a value (for a given key) is quick. Looking up a value in a linked list is much slower than a perfect, collision-free hash map of the same size. A hash map that uses separate chaining with linked lists but experiences frequent collisions loses one of its most essential features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Separate chaining involves assigning two or more keys with the same hash to different parts of the underlying data structure. How do we know which values relate back to which keys? If the linked list at the array index given by the hash has multiple elements, they would be indistinguishable to someone with just the key.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we save both the key and the value, then we will be able to check against the saved key when we’re accessing data in a hash map. By saving the key with the value, we can avoid situations in which two keys have the same hash code where we might not be able to distinguish which value goes with a given key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, when we go to read or write a value for a key we do the following: calculate the hash for the key, find the appropriate index for that hash, and begin iterating through our linked list. For each element, if the saved key is the same as our key, return the value. Otherwise, continue iterating through the list comparing the keys saved in that list with our key.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Open Addressing: Linear Probing\n",
    "\n",
    "Another popular hash collision strategy is called open addressing. In open addressing we stick to the array as our underlying data structure, but we continue looking for a new index to save our data if the first result of our hash function has a different key’s data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common open method of open addressing is called probing. Probing means continuing to find new array indices in a fixed sequence until an empty index is found. When looking up the value we search firs in the hashed index bucket, if the value is different there, then we keep searhing in the next bucket\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other Open Addressing Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "There are more sophisticated ways to find the next address after a hash collision, although anything too calculation-intensive would negatively affect a hash table’s performance. Linear probing systems, for instance, could jump by five steps instead of one step.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a **quadratic probing open addressing** system, we add increasingly large numbers to the hash code. At the first collision we just add 1, but if the hash collides there too we add 4 ,and the third time we add 9. Having a probe sequence change over time like this avoids clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Clustering** is what happens when a single hash collision causes additional hash collisions. Imagine a hash collision triggers a linear probing sequence to assigns a value to the next hash bucket over. Any key that would hash to this “next bucket” will now collide with a key that, in a sense, doesn’t belong to that bucket anyway.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result the new key needs to be assigned to the next, next bucket over. This propagates the problem because now there are two hash buckets taken up by key-value pairs that were assigned as a result of a hash collision, displacing further pairs of information we might want to save to the table.\n"

    "### Creating the HashMap Class\n",
    "\n",
    "Hash maps are efficient key-value stores. They are capable of assigning and retrieving data in the fastest way possible for a data structure. This is because the underlying data structure that they use is an array. A value is stored at an array index determined by plugging the key into a hash function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python we don’t have an array data structure that uses a contiguous block of memory. We are going to simulate an array by creating a list and keeping track of the size of the list with an additional integer variable. This will allow us to design something that resembles a hash map. This is somewhat elaborate for the actual storage of a key-value pair, but it helps to remember that the purpose of this lesson is to gain a deeper understanding of the structure as it is constructed. For real-world use cases in which a key-value store is needed, Python offers a built-in hash table implementation with dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a class called HashMap.\n",
    "2. Give HashMap a constructor which takes both self and array_size as parameters. array_size should be assigned to an instance variable of the same name (.array_size), and represents the size of the array.\n",
    "3. Create an instance variable called .array, which is a list of size array_size. Make each element of .array equal to None.\n",
    "4. Create a method for HashMap called .hash(). This method should take two arguments: self and key.\n",
    "5. Turn the key into a list of bytes by calling key.encode(). Save this into a variable called key_bytes. (.encode() is a string method that converts a string into its corresponding bytes, a list-like object with the numerical representation of each character in the string.)\n",
    "6. Turn the bytes object into a hash code by calling sum() on key_bytes. Save the result from that into a variable called hash_code.\n",
    "7. Return hash_code.\n",
    "8. Create a .compressor() method for your hash map. It should take two parameters: self and hash_code.\n",
    "9. Take the modulus of the hash code by the map’s array_size in order to reduce the hash code to a possible index for the array. Return the modulus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we have to define a Setter. We need to put together all the other steps we’ve taken: plug the key into the hash function, plug the hash code into the compression function, use the array index to find the place in the array, and finally set the value of the array to the value we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Create a .assign() method for the hash map. It should take three parameters: self, key, and value.\n",
    "11. Save the value (just the value for now) to the map’s array at the index determined by plugging the key into the .hash() method and plugging the hash code into the .compressor() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating the Getter:\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Define a .retrieve()method for HashMap. It should take two parameters: self and key.\n",
    "13. .retrieve() should calculate the array index in the same way our .assign() does and then retrieve the value at that index. Return that value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling Collisions: we have to rework the setter and the getter\n",
    "\n",
    "14. In order to avoid overwriting the wrong key, check the existing value in the array at self.array[array_index]. Save this into current_array_value.\n",
    "15. Changing the Setter\n",
    "    There are 3 possibilities:\n",
    "    a. it has the same key as the key\n",
    "    b. it has a different key\n",
    "    c. it is None\n",
    "    If the current value is none, then instead of just saving the value save the [key, value] to the index\n",
    "    If current_array_value already has contents, check if the saved key is different from the key we are currently processing. If the keys are the same, overwrite the array value.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Changing the Getter\n",
    "    In our .retrieve() method, after finding the array index, we want to check to make sure that the index corresponds to the key we’re looking for. Save the array value at our compressed hash code into possible_return_value.\n",
    "    Instead of just returning the array’s contents at that index, check if possible_return_value is None. If so, return None.\n",
    "    If possible_return_value is not None, check if the first element in possible_return_value (index 0) is the same as key. If so, return possible_return_value[1], the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. Open Addressing\n",
    "    Give HashMap.hash() another parameter: count_collisions. This will be the number of times the .hash() has hit a collision. Have count_collisions default to 0. Instead of returning hash_code from .hash(), return hash_code + count_collisions.\n",
    "    **Open Addressing in the Setter**\n",
    "    Now that we have a hash function that uses the number of collisions to determine the hash code, we can update where we set a key in the event of a collision.\n",
    "    When we notice that the key we’re trying to set is different from the key at our hash code’s address, create a new variable called number_collisions, set that equal to 1.\n",
    "    After defining number_collisions, create a new while loop that checks if current_array_value[0] != key.\n",
    "    Call .hash() with both the key and number_collisions. Save that result into new_hash_code.\n",
    "    Plug new_hash_code into .compressor(). Save that result into new_array_index.\n",
    "    Check self.array at new_array_index and save the result as current_array_value. Check against the three possibilities:\n",
    "    If it’s None, save the [key, value] at self.array[new_array_index] and then return.\n",
    "    If it has a value, but the same key as key, overwrite the array at that address with [key, value] and then return.\n",
    "    If it has a value, but a different key, increment number_collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Open Addressing in the Getter**\n",
    "    With everything in our setter taken care of, we want to make sure that when we retrieve our value we’re retrieving the correct value.\n",
    "    In .retrieve() if possible_return_value has a different key than the one we’re looking for, we should continue searching. Define a new variable called retrieval_collisions and set it equal to 1.\n",
    "    Insert a new while loop that checks if possible_return_value[0] != key\n",
    "    In the while loop, we want to replicate our retrieval logic while increasing the count of retrieval_collisions so that we continue to look at other locations within our array.\n",
    "    Call .hash() with both the key and retrieval_collisions. Save that result into new_hash_code.\n",
    "    Plug new_hash_code into .compressor(). Save that result into retrieving_array_index.\n",
    "    Check self.array at retrieving_array_index and save the result as possible_return_value. Check against the three possibilities:\n",
    "    If it’s None, return None\n",
    "    If it has a value, but a different key, increment retrieval_collisions.\n",
    "    If it’s key matches our key return possible_return_value[1].\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic hash map functionality is ready.\n",
    "Things to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How would you delete a key-value pair from this hash map?\n",
    "- Parts of the code are a little repetitive, how would you factor these roles differently?\n",
    "- What should your hash map do if a key-value is added and the array is full? How does this hash map handle that?\n"
