    "Towers of Hanoi is an ancient mathematical puzzle that starts off with three stacks and many disks.\n",
    "\n",
    "alt text\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of the game is to move the stack of disks from the leftmost stack to the rightmost stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "The game follows three rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n",
    "    Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.\n",
    "    No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this game, we will have three stacks. Each of these stacks will have a name. \n",
    "In addition, there is also a get_name method, a get_size method, and a print_items method that we will use later on in the project."

    "### Create the Game:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. create a variable, stacks, and set it equal to an empty list\n",
    "2. create three Stack instances: left_stack, middle_stack, right_stack. Give them the respective names of \"Left\", \"Middle\", and \"Right\"\n",
    "3. Append each of these Stack instances to stacks.\n",
    "4. Create the disks: create a variable, num_disks, and set it equal to the int representation of the user input when asked \"\\nHow many disks do you want to play with?\\n\"\n",
    "5. Now, we will add our disks. We will represent disks with numbers. Disk 3 is larger than Disk 1 etc. Create a for loop that iterates backwards through the range of the num_disks.\n",
    "6. In the for loop, push the number onto the left_stack.\n",
    "7. For towers of hanoi, the number of optimal moves is always 2**(Number of Disks - 1).\n",
    "8. print, \"\\nThe fastest you can solve this game is in {0} moves\" {0} corresponds to the num_optimal_moves.\n",
    "9. let’s create a helper function that prompts users to choose a stack. We want to have users only enter the first letter. define a function called get_input that takes in no parameters.\n",
    "10. Instead of hard-coding the letters like choices = ['L', 'M', 'R'], try and use the .get_name method of the stacks and a list comprehension.\n",
    "11. we will keep asking the user for an input until we get one that is valid. Still inside the get_input() function, create a while True loop.\n",
    "12. First, let’s print our choices. We will do so by iterating through the stacks and printing the corresponding first letter and name.\n",
    "13. let’s get the user input: After the for loop, but still inside the while loop: Create a variable user_input. Set it equal to an input of empty quotes.\n",
    "14. Let’s test it out. In the terminal, run python3 -c 'import script; script.get_input()' **Explanation in the next cell**\n",
    "15. let’s check if the user made a valid choice. In the while loop, create an if statement that checks the following: user_input is in choices. Inside that conditional statement, we want to check which stack the user chose. Inside the if statement, create a for loop that uses an iterator, i, to iterate through the range of the length of stacks.\n",
    "16. Inside the for loop, do the following: Check if user_input is equal to choices[i] If so, return stacks[i]\n",
    "17. Let’s write code to play the game. Start off by creating a variable, num_user_moves, and setting it equal to 0.\n",
    "18. The game ends when the right_stack is full. Create a while loop that loops while the size of the right_stack is not equal to num_disks. Use the .get_size() method.\n",
    "19. First, we want to print our current stacks. In the while loop, do the following: print \"\\n\\n\\n...Current Stacks...\" Iterate through stacks and call the .print_items() method on each stack.\n",
    "20. we will keep asking the user what move they want to make until they make a valid move. After printing the stacks, but still in the while loop, create a while True loop.\n",
    "21. In this inner loop, start off by doing the following:\n",
    "    Print \"\\nWhich stack do you want to move from?\\n\"\n",
    "    Create a variable, from_stack, and set it equal to the return value of get_input()\n",
    "    Print \"\\nWhich stack do you want to move to?\\n\"\n",
    "    Create a variable, to_stack, and set it equal to the return value of get_input()\n",
    "22. Now, we will make the move. First, we will check if the user made a valid move. If the user tried to move from an empty stack, that is an invalid move because there is nothing to move. In the inner while loop, create an if statement that checks if the from_stack is empty. If so, print \"\\n\\nInvalid Move. Try Again\".\n",
    "23. If the user moves a disk to an empty stack or moves a disk onto a larger disk, that’s a valid move.\n",
    "In the inner while loop, create an elif statement that checks if EITHER of the following is True:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The to_stack is empty.\n",
    "    The “peeked” value of the from_stack is less than the “peeked” of the to_stack\n",
    "\n",
    "If so, do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Create a variable, disk, and set it equal to the popped value of the from_stack.\n",
    "    Push disk onto the to_stack\n",
    "    Increment num_user_moves\n",
    "    break from the inner while loop\n",
    "\n",
    "24. The only other case is if the user tries to move a larger disk onto a smaller disk. In the inner while loop, create an else statement. Inside it, print \"\\n\\nInvalid Move. Try Again\"\n",
    "\n",
    "25. Finally, after both while loops, print the following: \"\\n\\nYou completed the game in {0} moves, and the optimal number of moves is {1}\". {0} corresponds to num_user_moves and {1} corresponds to num_optimal_moves.\n"
