    "3. **Nodes Python Setter**:We are only allowing the value of the node to be set upon creation. However, we want to allow updating the link of the node. For this, we will use a setter to modify the self.link_node attribute.\n",

    "Finding the Matching and Preceding Nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at what implementing steps 1 and 2 looks like. In order to swap the two nodes, we must first find them. We also need to keep track of the nodes that precede them so that we can properly reset their pointers. (We will use the Node class’s .get_next_node() method in order to access the next node.)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start by setting node1 equal to the head of the list, and then creating a while loop that runs while node1 isn’t None. Inside the loop, we will check if node1‘s value matches val1. If so, we break out of the loop as we have found the correct node. If there is no match, we update node1_prev to be node1 and move node1 to its next node:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def swap_nodes(input_list, val1, val2):\n",
    "  node1 = input_list.head_node\n",
    "  node2 = input_list.head_node\n",
    "  node1_prev = None\n",
    "  node2_prev = None\n",
    "\n",
    "  while node1 is not None:\n",
    "    if node1.get_value() == val1:\n",
    "      break\n",
    "# since we broke out of the loop the node1_prev walue was assigned in the previous iteration,\n",
    "# so it still holds the node which is before the actual node we were looking for and similarly\n",
    "# node1 stores the actual node we were looking for (in the previous iteration it was the next one)\n",
    "    node1_prev = node1\n",
    "    node1 = node1.get_next_node()\n",
    "```\n",
    "Updating the Preceding Nodes’ Pointers\n",
    "\n",
    "Our next step is to set node1_prev and node2_prev‘s next nodes, starting with node1_prev. We’ll begin by checking if node1_prev is None. If it is, then the node1 is the head of the list, and so we will update the head to be node2. If node1_prev isn’t None, then we set its next node to node2:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Still inside the swap_nodes() function\n",
    "if node1_prev is None:\n",

    "else:\n",
    "  node1_prev.set_next_node(node2);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After this step, we have finished updating the pointers that point to our swapped nodes. The next step will be to update the pointers from them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Updating the Nodes’ Next Pointers\n",
    "\n",
    "The last step is to update the pointers from node1 and node2. This is relatively simple, and mirrors a swapping function for an array in that we will use a temporary variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "temp = node1.get_next_node()\n",
    "node1.set_next_node(node2.get_next_node())\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Edge Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "We have completed the basic swap algorithm in Python! However, we haven’t accounted for some edge cases. What if there is no matching node for one of the inputs? The current swap_nodes() function will not run because we will try to access the next node of a node that is None. (Remember that our initial while loop only breaks if the matching node is found. Otherwise, it runs until the node is None.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Thankfully this has a quick fix. We can put in an if that checks if either node1 or node2 is None. If they are, we can print a statement that explains a match was not found, and return to end the method. We can put this right after the while loops that iterate through the list to find the matching nodes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if (node1 is None or node2 is None):\n",
    "  print(\"Swap not possible - one or more element is not in the list\")\n",
    "  return\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The last edge case is if the two nodes to be swapped are the same. While our current implementation will run without error, there’s no point in executing the whole function if it isn’t necessary. We can add a brief check at the beginning of the function that checks if the val1 is the same as val2, and then return to end the function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if val1 == val2:\n",
    "  print(\"Elements are the same - no swap needed\")\n",
