    "### Bubble Sort Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Bubble sort is an introductory sorting algorithm that iterates through a list and compares pairings of adjacent elements.\n",
    "According to the sorting criteria, the algorithm swaps elements to shift elements towards the beginning or end of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "We implement the algorithm with two loops.\n",
    "The first loop iterates as long as the list is unsorted and we assume it’s unsorted to start.\n",
    "Within this loop, another iteration moves through the list. For each pairing, the algorithm asks:\n",
    "In comparison, is the first element larger than the second element?\n",
    "If it is, we swap the position of the elements. The larger element is now at a greater index than the smaller element.\n",
    "When a swap is made, we know the list is still unsorted. The outer loop will run again when the inner loop concludes.\n",
    "The process repeats until the largest element makes its way to the last index of the list. The outer loop runs until no swaps are made within the inner loop.\n"

    "### Merge Sort \n",
    "\n",
    "is a sorting algorithm created by John von Neumann in 1945. Merge sort’s “killer app” was the strategy that breaks the list-to-be-sorted into smaller parts, sometimes called a divide-and-conquer algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a divide-and-conquer algorithm, the data is continually broken down into smaller elements until sorting them becomes really simple.\n",
    "Merge sort was the first of many sorts that use this strategy, and is still in use today in many different applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Merge sorting takes two steps: splitting the data into “runs” or smaller components, and the re-combining those runs into sorted lists (the “merge”).\n",
    "\n",
    "When **splitting** the data, we divide the input to our sort in half. We then recursively call the sort on each of those halves, which cuts the halves into quarters. This process continues until all of the lists contain only a single element. Then we begin merging.\n",
    "\n",
    "When merging two single-element lists, we check if the first element is smaller or larger than the other. Then we return the two-element list with the smaller element followed by the larger element.\n",
    "\n",
    "When **merging** larger pre-sorted lists, we build the list similarly to how we did with single-element lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s call the two lists left and right. Both left and right are already sorted. We want to combine them (to merge them) into a larger sorted list, let’s call it both. To accomplish this we’ll need to iterate through both with two indices, left_index and right_index.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first left_index and right_index both point to the start of their respective lists. left_index points to the smallest element of left (its first element) and right_index points to the smallest element of right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare the elements at left_index and right_index. The smaller of these two elements should be the first element of both because it’s the smallest of both! It’s the smallest of the two smallest values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say that smallest value was in left. We continue by incrementing left_index to point to the next-smallest value in left. Then we compare the 2nd smallest value in left against the smallest value of right. Whichever is smaller of these two is now the 2nd smallest value of both.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process of “look at the two next-smallest elements of each list and add the smaller one to our resulting list” continues on for as long as both lists have elements to compare. Once one list is exhausted, say every element from left has been added to the result, then we know that all the elements of the other list, right, should go at the end of the resulting list (they’re larger than every element we’ve added so far).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Merge Sort Performance**\n",
    "\n",
    "Merge sort was unique for its time in that the best, worst, and average time complexity are all the same: Θ(N*log(N)). This means an almost-sorted list will take the same amount of time as a completely out-of-order list. This is acceptable because the worst-case scenario, where a sort could stand to take the most time, is as fast as a sorting algorithm can be.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some sorts attempt to improve upon the merge sort by first inspecting the input and looking for “runs” that are already pre-sorted. Timsort is one such algorithm that attempts to use pre-sorted data in a list to the sorting algorithm’s advantage. If the data is already sorted, Timsort runs in Θ(N) time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Merge sort also requires space. Each separation requires a temporary array, and so a merge sort would require enough space to save the whole of the input a second time. This means the worst-case space complexity of merge sort is O(N).\n"

    "The graphic displays two data sets which always use the first element as the pivot. Notice how many more steps are required when the quicksort algorithm is run on an already sorted input. The partition step of the algorithm hardly divides the array at all!\n",

    "### Quicksort Python Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll be implementing a version of the quicksort algorithm in Python. Quicksort is an efficient way of sorting a list of values by partitioning the list into smaller sub-lists based on comparisons with a single “pivot” element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our algorithm will be recursive, so we’ll have a base case and an inductive step that takes us closer to the base case. We’ll also sort our list in-place to keep it as efficient as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sorting in place means we’ll need to keep track of the sub-lists in our algorithm using pointers and swap values inside the list rather than create new lists. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. In qs.py, define our quicksort function with list, start, and end as parameters.\n",
    "2. We’re going to be passing in the same list as an argument for each recursive call, but start and end will mark what part of the list we’re considering. Our base case is when the list from start to end contains one or zero elements.\n",
    "3. Let’s start with a simple inductive step that takes us closer to the base case we’ve just defined. After the if statement, print out the element at start. Then, increment start by one and recursively call quicksort with list, start, and end.\n",
    "4. We’ve imported the randrange() function to assist with the random pivot. Check the documentation for how it works. Use this function to create the variable pivot_idx, a random index between start and end.\n",
    "5. Make another variable pivot_element and use pivot_idx to retrieve the value located in the list which was passed in as an argument.\n",
    "6. Random is great because it protects our algorithm against inefficient runtimes, but our code will be simpler for the remainder of the algorithm if we know the pivot will always be in the same place. Swap the end element of the list with the pivot_idx so we know the pivot element will always be located at the end of the list.\n",
    "7. Partitioning in place\n",
    "    We need to partition our list into two sub-lists of greater than or smaller than elements, and we’re going to do this “in-place” without creating new lists. Strap in, this is the most complex portion of the algorithm!\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we’re doing this in-place, we’ll need two pointers. One pointer will keep track of the “lesser than” elements. We can think of it as the border where all values at a lower index are lower in value to the pivot. The other pointer will track our progress through the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s explore how this will work in an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "[5, 6, 2, 3, 1, 4]\n",
    "# we randomly select \"3\" and swap with the last element\n",

    "# Then we increment the \"lesser than\" pointer\n",

    "# {1} is less than 3, so we SWAP the values...\n",
    "[2, (1), 5, 4, {6}, 3]\n",
    "# Then we increment the \"lesser than\" pointer\n",

    "# We've reached the end of the non-pivot values\n",
    "[2, 1, (5), 4, 6, {3}]\n",
    "# Swap the \"lesser than\" pointer with the pivot...\n",
    "[2, 1, (3), 4, 6, {5}]\n",
    "\n",
    "Tada! We have successfully partitioned this list. Note that the “sub-lists” are not necessarily sorted, we’ll need to recursively run the algorithm on each sub-list, but the pivot has arrived at the correct location within the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Create the variable lesser_than_pointer and assign it to the start of the list.\n",
    "9. Create a for loop that iterates from start to end, and set the iterating variable to idx. This will track our progress through the list (or sub-list) we’re partitioning. To start, write continue in the for loop.\n",
    "10. Within the loop, remove continue and replace it with a conditional. We need to do something if the element at idx is less than pivot_element.\n",
    "    If so:\n",
    "    Use parallel assignment to swap the values at lesser_than_pointer and idx.\n",
    "    Increment the lesser_than_pointer\n",
    "11. Once the loop concludes, use parallel assignment to swap the pivot element with the value located at lesser_than_pointer.\n",
    "12. Complete our quicksort algorithm by recursively calling quicksort on the left and right sub-lists. The left sub-list is marked from start to less_than_pointer - 1. The right sub-list is marked from less_than_pointer + 1 to end. less_than_pointer marks the location of the pivot element and we’ve just swapped it into the correct location. We want to sort the sub-lists to the left (-1) and right +1 of that pivot.\n",
