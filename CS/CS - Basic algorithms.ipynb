    "### Asymptotic Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "when scaling programs to deal with massive amounts of data, writing efficient code becomes the difference between success and failure. In computer science, we define how efficient a program is by its **runtime**.\n",
    "\n",
    "With asymptotic notation, we calculate a program’s runtime by looking at how many instructions the computer has to perform based on the size of the program’s input. \n",
    "\n",
    "In asymptotic notation, we define the size of the input as N. I may be looking through a collection of 10 elements, or 100 elements, but we only need to know how many steps are performed relative to the input so N is used in place of a specific number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically programmers will focus on the worst case scenario so there is an upper bound of runtime to communicate. It’s a way of saying “things may get this bad, or slow, but they won’t get worse!”\n",
    "\n",
    "For determining the notation we get rid of the constants and if N is on some power we get rid of the N too. So if the computer performs N^2 + 3N + 4 instructions we consider this N^2.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three different ways we could describe the runtime of this program: big Theta or Θ(N2), big O or O(N2), big Omega or Ω(N2). The difference between the three and when to use which one will be detailed in the next exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Big Theta (Θ)\n",
    "We use big Theta when a program has only one case in terms of runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a list of common runtimes that run from fastest to slowest.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Θ(1). This is constant runtime. This is the runtime when a program will always do the same thing regardless of the input. For instance, a program that only prints “hello, world” runs in Θ(1) because the program will always just print “hello, world”.\n",
    "    Θ(log N). This is logarithmic runtime. You will see this runtime in search algorithms.\n",
    "    Θ(N). This is linear runtime. You will often see this when you have to iterate through an entire dataset.\n",
    "    Θ(N*logN). You will see this runtime in sorting algorithms.\n",
    "    Θ(N2). This is an example of a polynomial runtime. When N is raised to the 2nd power, it’s known as a quadratic runtime. You will see this runtime when you have to search through a two-dimensional dataset (like a matrix) or nested loops.\n",
    "    Θ(2N). This is exponential runtime. You will often see this runtime in recursive algorithms (Don’t worry if you don’t know what that is yet!).\n",
    "    Θ(N!). This is factorial runtime. You will often see this runtime when you have to generate all of the different permutations of something. For instance, a program that generates all the different ways to order the letters “abcd” would run in this runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Big Omega (Ω) and Big O (O)\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, a program may have a different runtime for the best case and worst case. For instance, a program could have a best case runtime of Θ(1) and a worst case of Θ(N). We use a different notation when this is the case. We use big Omega or Ω to describe the best case and big O or O to describe the worst case. \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, when describing runtime, people typically discuss the worst case because you should always prepare for the worst case scenario! Often times, in technical interviews, they will only ask you for the big O of a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a program runs multiple runtimes we could add up the different runtimes, but usually we just take the slowest one to describe the asymptotic notation:\n",
    "Rather than look at this program all at once, let’s divide into two chunks: the first loop and the second loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In the first loop, we iterate until we reach N. Thus the runtime of the first loop is Θ(N).\n",
    "    However, the second loop, as demonstrated in a previous exercise, runs in Θ(log N).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can add the runtimes together, so the runtime is Θ(N) + Θ(log N).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when analyzing the runtime of a program, we only care about the slowest part of the program, and because Θ(N) is slower than Θ(log N), we would actually just say the runtime of this program is Θ(N). It is also appropriate to say the runtime is O(N) because if it runs in Θ(N) for every case, then it also runs in Θ(N) for the worst case. Most of the time people will just use big O notation."

    "### Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Asymptotic notation is often used to describe the runtime of a program or algorithm, but it can also be used to describe the space, or memory, that a program or algorithm will need.\n",
    "\n",

    "This function has a space complexity of O(1), because the amount of space it needs will not change based on the input. While this function also has a constant runtime of O(1), most functions do not have matching space and time complexities.\n",

    "def simple_loop(input_array):\n",
    "  for i in input_array:\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "As we know, a simple for loop that goes through every element in an array of size n has a linear runtime of O(n). However, this function takes O(1) space since no new variables are being created and therefore no more space must be allocated. \n",
    "\n",
    "Like with time complexity, space complexity denotes space growth in relation to the input size. It’s also important to note that space complexity usually refers to any additional space that will be needed, and doesn’t count the space of the input. So a function could have 10 arrays passed into it, but if all it does inside is print 'Hello World!', then it still takes O(1) space. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def double_array(input_array):\n",
    "  # Returns an array that is the double of the input array\n",
    "  length = len(input_array)\n",
    "  doubled_array = [0] * length\n",
    "  for i in range(length):\n",
    "    doubled_array[i] = input_array[i] * 2\n",
    "  return doubled_array\n",
    "```\n",
    "Consider the double_array() function from above. It has a runtime of O(n), and takes O(n) space. Could we optimize it to have a better space complexity?\n",
