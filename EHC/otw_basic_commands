ps 	- processes running for the current user
ps aux 	- all running processes
sudo systemctl start / enable / stop service
most malicious software will appear in the processes

top / htop
similar to ps but updating constantly
malware used to appear on the top (resource hungry)
q - to quit top


kill processes
sudo kill -9 PID 	the dirty way, no cleanup: 
			the preferred way to kill suspicious processes
sometimes the process will pop again after killing

Schedule a job / script
1. at (might need to install)
at 9:00pm / noon / midnight / now + 3 hours...
at propmt> add a binary from /bin/sh
it is good for simple single scans

2. recurring jobs need crontab
best for sys admins
