** ifconfig (ip address)
shows the nework interfaces


** iwconfig
shows the wireless interfaces
virtual machines convert the wireless connection int a lan connection on the guest machine


IP addresses are assigned by the DHCP server on your network (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
These are dynamic IP addresses

To change the dynamic IP address to static:
** sudo ifconfig eth0 (eno1) 192.168.0.101 - gives a static ip address
you won't be able to connect to the internet, but still can connect to other machines within the LAN.
easy check for internet connectivity:
** ping google.com

To revert back to DHCP:
** sudo dhclient eth0 (eno1)

DNS
IP address(es) are converted into a domain name

** dig tesla.com ns - name server
** dig tesla.com mx - mail server

**sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
the configuration file where the DNS resolution starts
you can change the nameserver, but it is recommended to use something in the neighborhood (ISP)
(google ns: 8.8.8.8)

to see the running service:
** resolvectl status

DNS creates a UDP traffic and not TCP
Port 53 is the DNS

NMAP
tries to determine which ports (services) are open on the target
(shodan is similar)
ping the target first if it is up 
(sometimes ping 1is dropped on the target system, but it doesn't mean the system is not up)

TCP-IP protocol:
3 way handshake:
connection request from the client (SYN)
SYN-ACK from the server
ACK from the client
after this the connection is established

nmap is using the TCP flags the client and the server are sending to determine which port are open
** nmap -sT 192.168.107.15 - reliable scan which tries to connect to top 1000 port
** nmap -sT 192.168.107.15 -p 53 - checking just one port

most commonly used ports
53 - DNS
80 - http
444 - https

you can open and close TCP ports with nc:
** sudo nc -l -p 53 -> open port 53 for listening

nmap will name the ports by the default service (53 = domain or DNS)
but we know that we opened the port for TCP connection
to make nmap determine the port protocol use -A

** nmap -sT -A 192.168.107.15 -p 53 - checking the ports and probe them what services they are running
** nmap -sS -A  -> called the stealth scan (it doesn't use the 3-way handshake) 
but your IP address will still be registered 
(the webserver will not log your IP address but the system itself can see it)


from the target side:
wireshark can detect the connection requests like ping or nmap


We can also change our MAC address:
Usually WiFi access points are set up to use MAC Address filtering.
So to access the wifi we need to change our mac address to one of the allowed ones (white list).

** sudo ifconfig eth0 down - take down the interface
** sudo ifconfig eth0 hw ether 00:00:00:00:00:00 -> valid values: (0-9, a-f) Set the new MAC address
** sudo ifconfig eth0 up
