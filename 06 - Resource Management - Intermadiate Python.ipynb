    "### The with Statement\n",
    "One of the most common ways to manage resources in Python is to make sure the files we use in our scripts are properly closed after use.\n",
    "\n",
    "We already explored this concept when we used the with statement when operating on files. The with statement is the most common and pythonic way of invoking context managers in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, what exactly does this have to do with resource management? In order to answer this question, we need to take a peek behind the curtain and examine what our code looks like without a with statement. Here is what the same code would look like without the use of a context manager like with:\n",
    "```\n",
    "file = open(\"file_name.txt\", \"w\")\n",
    "try:\n",
    "   file.write(\"How you gonna win when you ain't right within?\")\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "   file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "The alternative to using with would require us to manually open (using open()) and close (using close()) the file we are working on. By using the with statement in the first example, it serves as a context manager where files are automatically closed after script completion and we don’t ever have to worry about the possibility of forgetting to close a resource. Remember, leaving our resources open will hog up our finite computer resources."

    "### Class Based Context Managers\n",
    "Now that we have an understanding of why we need context managers and the power of the with statement, it is essential for us to know what’s happening under the hood to gain a much deeper understanding of the concept. The best way to see the internal workings of a context manager (such as the with statement) is by creating our own!\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the two approaches of creating context managers is referred to as the class-based approach. The class-based approach of writing context managers requires explicitly defining and implementing the following two methods inside of a class:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An __enter__ method\n",
    "The __enter__ method allows for the setup of context managers. This method commonly takes care of opening resources (like files). This method also begins what is known as the runtime context - the period of time in which a script runs. In our previous examples, it was the time in which the code passed into the with statement code block was executed (basically everything under the with statement).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. An __exit__ method\n",
    "The __exit__ ensures the breakdown of the context manager. This method commonly takes care of closing open resources that are no longer in use.\n",
    "To visualize these methods and the approach, let’s take a look at a custom class-based context manager below:\n",
    "```\n",
    "class ContextManager:\n",
    "  def __init__(self):\n",
    "    print('Initializing class...')\n",
    " \n",
    "  def __enter__(self):\n",
    "    print('Entering context...')\n",
    " \n",
    "  def __exit__(self, *exc):\n",
    "    print('Exiting context...')\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, we defined a new class called ContextManager (to be extra explicit) and implemented the required methods. By defining these two methods, we are implementing the context management protocol - a guideline for the required methods for a context manager. Don’t get too caught up in the arguments passed to each method, we will talk through them in the next exercises, but they are required to not experience an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing the context management protocol allows us to immediately invoke the class using the with statement as shown below:\n",
    "```\n",
    "with ContextManager() as cm:\n",
    "  print('Code inside with statement')\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here we invoke the ContextManager class with a with statement.\n",
    "After running the code, our output of this context manager would be:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Initializing class...\n",
    "Entering context...\n",
    "Code inside with statement\n",
    "Exiting context...\n",
    "```\n",
    "The above shows that our context manager class is executed in the following sequence:\n",
    "\n",
    "__init__ method\n",
    "__enter__ method\n",
    "The code in the with statement block\n",
    "__exit__ method\n",
    "Let’s practice getting down the basics of writing a class-based context manager in addition to the execution flow before diving deeper into the __enter__ and __exit__ methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: in reality, we wouldn’t have to create a context manager that opens a file because there’s already an open() built-in function that you can run with a with statement that will open and close a file. However, open() has its limitations, and knowing this base structure will allow us to create our own custom and more advanced context managers that can do much more than open()!"

    "It’s time to address the big mystery. What in the world is the *exc parameter in the __exit__ method we have been writing so far?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, context managers play an important role in handling exceptions. Recall exceptions are errors that happen within the runtime of a code, terminating it before its completion. Within a context manager, the __exit__ method is responsible for dealing with any exceptions. It can implement how to close the file and any other operations we want to perform if an exception occurs.\n",

In the past exercises, we ignored this requirement by using the * operator to tell the method we will pass a variable number of arguments even though we never did. It was a good way to put the above error on hold, but now let’s dive into what these required arguments are and how to use them so that we can master the __exit__ method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The __exit__ method has three required arguments (in addition to self):\n",
    "1. An exception type: which indicates the class of exception (i.e. AttributeError class, or NameError class)\n",
    "2. An exception value: the actual value of the error\n",
    "3. A traceback: a report detailing the sequence of steps that caused the error and all the details needed to fix the error.\n",

Lastly, we return True to make sure we suppress the exception from arising and stopping the rest of our code from running.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: Remember that the __exit__() method’s primary responsibility is to close the resource the context manager is working with. In this example, we close the file first, before handling the error, so that it will always execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction to Contextlib\n",
    "We’ve learned that we can create our own context managers using the class-based method, but there’s an even simpler way of creating context managers. We can use a built-in Python module called contextlib!\n",

Instead of creating a class and definining __enter__ and __exit__ methods, we can use a simple function!\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few steps in the setup so let’s take it slow and break down each step. First, we will need to import the built-in module into our script and grab the @contextmanager decorator:\n",
    "\n",
    "`from contextlib import contextmanager`\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have successfully imported the module, we can automatically use the @contextmanager decorator to wrap a simple generator function:\n",

    "\n",
    "@contextmanager\n",
    "def open_file_contextlib(file, mode):\n",
    "  opened_file = open(file, mode)\n",
    " try:\n",
    "   yield opened_file\n",
    " finally:\n",
    "   opened_file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "We are doing a few things here:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We have written a generator function called open_file_contextlib with the expectation that it will take in two arguments, a file and a mode.\n",
    "- We then use the built-in open() function to open the file (that we received as an argument) and save it to a variable called opened_file.\n",
    "- The function then will attempt (via a try statement) to yield the opened file and complete whatever code we pass when we use it in conjunction with the with statement. More on this in a bit!\n",
    "- Lastly the resource (file) will be closed once all the code is done being executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have created this function and denoted it as a context manager using the @contextmanager decorator, we can immediately use it like before in a with statement:\n",
    "```\n",
    "with open_file_contextlib('file.txt', 'w') as opened_file:\n",
    " opened_file.write('We just made a context manager using contexlib')\n",

    "### Nested Context Managers\n",
    "So far, we’ve only been using context managers within the context (Ha! Get it?) of one file. In most programs, there might be a need to use context managers for a couple of different scenarios that include working with multiple files! For example, we might want to:\n",

    "- Copy the same information to multiple files.\n",
    "- Copy information from one file to another.\n",

    "- The resulting teacher.txt file will now include everything that was in the student.txt file.\n",
    "- Here we have chosen to use the open() built-in function rather than a custom context manager. It is entirely possible to use our own in place of the open() function.\n",

    "- The with statement statement to open student.txt in read mode is nested in the code block of the with statement that opens teacher.txt in write mode.\n",
