Each of these specialized containers focuses on a certain improvement to its built-in counterpart such as optimizing performance, better organization, fewer steps for performing tasks, and more!\n",

    "In Python, lists are one of the most common containers we use to work with data. Unfortunately, there are certain situations where they perform poorly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s imagine a situation where we are processing a large document containing bug reports for an application. In order to prioritize the most important bugs, we want any normal bug reports to be appended to the end of the list and higher priority bugs to be at the front of the list (kind of like a priority list). As we fix the bugs, they can be removed from the front of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program below is an example of what our implementation might look like using lists. Take some time to understand what the code is doing.\n",

    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, we can use deque containers. These are similar to lists, but they are optimized for appending and popping to the front and back, rather than having optimized accessing.

    "### Named Tuple\n",
    "Tuples, another common built-in container, are very useful for grouping together data that does not need to be modified in the future. Tuples do however run into an issue when they host various data and even nested data. Let’s examine a tuple containing actor data:\n",
    "\n",
    "`actor_data_tuple = ('Leonardo DiCaprio', 1974, 'Titanic', 1997)`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we are storing details about an actor that is unlikely to change (we can assume for now the actor’s name will not change). While the tuple does a great job of creating a container that can keep ordered immutable data, it can become quite confusing to represent properties using numerical indices. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "`actor_data_tuple[3]`\n",
    "\n",
    "Unless we explicitly define a variable name that describes what the third index represents, it’s very hard to tell what data we are talking about. We would also need to make separate variables for each property! Thanks to the collections module, we have a solution to this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The namedtuple collection allows us to have an immutable tuple object, but every element becomes self-documented. Let’s examine our actor example but now refactored to use a namedtuple:\n",
    "```\n",
    "from collections import namedtuple\n",
    "# General Structure: namedtuple(typename, field_names, *, rename=False, defaults=None, module=None)\n",
    "ActorData = namedtuple('ActorData', ['name', 'birth_year', 'movie', 'movie_release_date'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, we are defining an instance of the namedtuple collection with a typename called 'ActorData' and a sequence of strings called field_names that represent the labels for the data we want to store.\n",
    "We are saying we want our namedtuple to be called 'ActorData' and for it to have name, birth_year, movie, and movie_release_date properties. It’s like creating a label system for the type of data inside of the tuple!\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then define an instance of our ActorData:\n",
    "\n",
    "`actor_data = ActorData('Leonardo DiCaprio', 1974, 'Titanic', 1997)`\n",
    "\n",
    "This then allows us to access the mapped property value to its associated name from before using the . notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "`print(actor_data.name)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Would return:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Leonardo DiCaprio`\n",
    "\n",
    "Some things to note about namedtuples:\n",
    "- You may have noticed we use a CapWords convention when defining our namedtuple. This is because namedtuple actually returns a subclass and thus falls under the conventions we use for classes.\n",
    "- The field_names argument can alternatively be a single string with each fieldname separated by whitespace and/or commas, for example, 'x y' or 'x, y'.\n",
    "- At first glance, namedtuples might seem like it is trying to replicate a dictionary. While the key idea of labeling properties is the same in both structures, namedtuples have some key advantages over a regular dictionary:\n",
    "    - They are immutable and maintain their order, while a dictionary does not.\n",
    "    - They are more lightweight than dictionaries and take no more memory than a regular tuple.\n",
    "    - There are other useful methods that a namedtuple uses such as converting from a namedtuple to a dict, replacing elements and field names, and even setting default values for attributes.\n",

    "There is another way to store dictionaries or other mappings in Python. We have looked at the defaultdict and OrderedDict so far and they handle a lot of situations so what else could we possibly need?\n",

    "Well, the ChainMap container allows us to store many mappings in an ordered group, but lookups (accessing the value using a key) are repeated for every mapping inside of the ChainMap until something is found or the end is reached. If we try to modify the data in any way, then only the first mapping in the ChainMap will receive the changes. When accessing data, one way to think of the ChainMap is that it treats all of the stored dictionaries as one large dictionary, where if there are repeated keys, then the first found result is returned. Let’s see what this looks like with an example using a customer’s clothing dimensions!\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we import the ChainMap container and set up our data.\n",

    "```\n",
    "Next, we initialize a ChainMap with the mappings which we want to use. In this case, the mappings are the dimensions dictionaries.\n",
    "```\n",
    "customer_data = ChainMap(customer_info, shirt_dimensions, pants_dimensions)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now we can access values from any of the stored mappings.\n",

    "We can directly modify the data only in the first dictionary.\n",

    "```\n",
    "Note: In order to modify data from dictionaries which are deeper in the ChainMap, we will need to iterate through the dictionaries which are stored inside of it.\n",

    "As we can see in this example, we create a new ChainMap using three different dictionaries. This allows us to access any of the key:value pairs stored inside.\n",

    "Another interesting concept that the ChainMap uses is the concept of a parent mappings. If we use the .parents property, all mappings except the first one will be returned. This is because those mappings are considered to be the parent mappings to the first one. You can add a new “child” mapping to the front of the list of mappings using the .new_child() method.\n",

    "### Container Wrappers\n",
    "In Python, wrappers are modifications to functions or classes which change the behavior in some way. They are called wrappers because they “wrap” around the existing code to modify it. This is most commonly used with function wrapping, but we can also wrap classes.\n",

    "    self.address = address\n",
    "    self.phone_number = phone_number\n",
    "```\n",
    "Next, we create a wrapper class which stores an object of the class we are wrapping around. It also includes some additional functionality.\n",
    "```\n",
    "class CustomerWrap(Customer):\n",
    "\n",
    "  def __init__(self, name, age, address, phone_number):\n",

    "    print('Address: ' + self.customer.address)\n",
    "    print('Phone Number: ' + self.customer.phone_number)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Finally, we can create an object from the wrapper class to access the new functionality and the wrapped class contained inside.\n",
    "```\n",
    "customer = CustomerWrap('Dmitri Buyer', 38, '123 Python Avenue', '5557098603')\n",

    "An advanced container which behaves like a regular dictionary, except that it does not throw an error when trying to access a key which does not exist. Instead, it creates a new key:value pair where the value defaults to what we provide in the constructor for the defaultdict.\n",

When accessing a value using a key, it will search through every mapping contained within until a match is found or the end is reached.
