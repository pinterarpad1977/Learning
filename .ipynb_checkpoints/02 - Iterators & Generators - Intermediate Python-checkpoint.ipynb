    "## Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, an iterable is an object that is capable of being looped through one element at a time. We commonly use iterables to perform the process of iteration and it is the backbone for how we perform consistent operations on sets of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries, lists, tuples, and sets are all classified as iterables!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Iterator Objects: `__iter__()` and `iter()`\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the hood, the first step that the for loop has to do is to convert our dictionary (the iterable) to an iterator object. An iterator object is a special object that represents a stream of data that we can operate on. To accomplish this, it uses a built-in function called `iter()`\n",
    "\n",
    "To go behind the scenes even further, `iter()` is actually calling a method defined within the iterable called `__iter__()`. All iterables have this `__iter__()` method defined. We can even use the Python built-in function `dir()` to show that a dictionary has a defined method called `__iter__()`"
