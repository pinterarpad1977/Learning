    "### 1. The assert Statement\n",
    "Python provides an easy way to perform simple tests in our code - the `assert` statement. An `assert` statement can be used to test that a condition is met. If the condition evaluates to `False`, an `AssertionError` is raised with an optional error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general syntax looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```assert <condition>, 'Message if condition is not met' ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "```\n",
    "def times_ten(number):\n",
    "    return number * 100\n",
    "\n",
    "result = times_ten(20)\n",
    "assert result == 200, 'Expected times_ten(20) to return 200, instead got ' + str(result)\n",
    "```"

    "### Unit Testing\n",
    "In programming we can test a single unit of a program, such as a function, loop, or variable. A unit test validates a single behavior and will make sure all of the units of a program are functioning properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test a single function, we might create several test cases. A test case validates that a specific set of inputs produces an expected output for the unit we are trying to test.\n",
    "A common approach is to create test cases for specific edge case inputs as well as reasonable ones. "

    "### Python's unittest Framework\n",
    "There are some problems with the approach to our previous unit tests that would make them difficult to maintain. First, we had to call each function specifically when a new test was created. We also didn’t have any way of grouping tests, which is necessary when the number of tests increases. Perhaps most importantly, if one test failed, the AssertionError would prevent any remaining tests from running!\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, Python provides a framework that solves these problems and provides many other tools for writing unit tests. This framework lives in the `unittest` module which is included in the standard library\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, we must create a class which inherits from `unittest.TestCase`.\n",
    "- This class will serve as the main storage of all our unit testing functions. Once we have the class, we need to change our test functions so that they are methods of the class. The `unittest` module requires that test functions begin with the word 'test'\n",
    "- Lastly, we need to change our `assert` statements to use the `assertEqual` method of `unittest.TestCase`. The framework requires that we use special methods instead of standard assert statements.\n",
