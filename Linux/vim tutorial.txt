When you open Vim it opens in 
*** NORMAL MODE ***
u -> undo
0 -> jumps to the front of the line
$ -> jumps to the end of the line
ESC -> escapes Insert Mode back to normal mode
x -> remowes the character the cursor is on
dd -> removes the line the cursor is on
h j k l -> moves the cursor around (left, right, up , down)
gg -> jumps to the top
G -> jumps to the end 



*** INSERT MODE ***
i -> enters insert mode, in insert mode you can add / edit text
A -> enters insert mode and jumps at the end of the line



*** COMMAND MODE ***
: -> puts Vim into COMMAND MODE
:w -> saves the file
:w filename -> Save As, or just save if it didn't have a name yet
:wq -> save and exit
:q to QUIT
:q! to QUIT without saving
:r path/filename -> reads in the content of the file given in the argument
:! linux command -> executes linux commands within vim (you don't need to exit vim)
:%s/what_to_replace/with_what/g -> find and replace
:split filename -> splits the window and show both buffers in the same screen(horizontal)
ctrl ww -> jump to the other file (the active file name will be bold)
:q -> closes the active file
:vsplit -> splits the screen vertically
you can open the same file in a split view to compare different parts of the file
:set number -> displays the line numbers
:set nonumber -> disdables line numbers


What is a Buffer?
It contains the text until we save it (:w)
Vim doesn't actually open the file, just reads its content into the buffer.
:e path/filename can read another file in another buffer
:bp -> goes to the previous buffer
:bn -> goes to the next buffer
:bd -> deletes the current buffer
:enew -> opens an empty buffer - it will disappear if we don't add anything and save it!
:badd filename -> adds a new buffer without jumping to it (see it with :bn)

*** VISUAL MODE ***
v -> enters visual mode - allows to select text (position the cursor before entering visual mode)
y -> copies the selected text in insert mode: p -> pastes the copied text 
:sort ui -> sorts the selected lines alphabetically

To make changes permanent in the config of Vim you need to create a .vimrc file in your home directory
" Adds line numbers
set number

to start vim at a particular lin number:
vim +20 filename -> puts the cursor on line 20 when opening

to start vim splitted:
vim -o first_file second_file (horizontal split)
vim -O first_file second_file (vertical split)
