- checking which shell is running: echo $SHELL
- scripts used to be saved with the .sh extension (not required, but common practice)
- to run the script make it executable:

	sudo chmod +x myscript.sh
	./myscript.sh

- scripts will be executed line-by-line from top to bottom

PROPER STRUCTURE
#!/bin/bash -> SHEBANG the first line

VARIABLES
define a variable with varname= ...
reference the variable with $varname
variables are tied to the bash terminal. After exiting they will disappear
to save a copmmand output to a variable:

	files=$(ls)
	now=$(date)

MATH FUNCTIONS
expr -> evaluate expression

	expr 30 + 40 ( + - / and \* for multiplication)

# IF - pay attention to spaces!

if [ $num1 -eq 100 ]
then
    echo "The condition is true."
else
    echo "The condition is false."
fi

# reverse logic with ! or use -ne : not equal
if [! $num1 -eq 100 ]
then
    echo "The condition is true."
else
    echo "The condition is false."
fi

# comparison:
# -eq : equals
# -ne : not equals
# -gt : greater than
# -f  : checks if a file exists
# !   : reverses the logic

# ------------------------------------------
#!/bin/bash

command=usr/bin/htop 

if [ -f $command ] 
then
    echo "$command is available, running it..."
else 
    echo "$command is NOT available, installing it..."
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y htop
fi

$command

# && chains commands together (if the first command is successful runs the second one too
# -y assume yes (don't ask questions)
